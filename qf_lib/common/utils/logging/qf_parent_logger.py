"""
This is the preferred way of using logger in the project. All loggers are the children of QF and therefore
can be filtered in the logging settings.

Usage:

from qf_lib.common.utils.logging.qf_parent_logger import qf_logger

Now in the class you can call
    self.logger = qf_logger.getChild(self.__class__.__name__)
which will create an instance of a logger.
