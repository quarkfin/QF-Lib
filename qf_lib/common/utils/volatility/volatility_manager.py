    VolatilityManager uses rolling window to asses the historical volatility of a series.

        series to be volatility managed
    frequency: Frequency
        frequency of the series that is passed

        Parameters
        ----------
        vol_level: float

        window_size: int
            length of the window to asses the volatility
        lag: int
            how many periods do we need in order to implement the reallocation.
            1 means that already on close of the current day we adjust for the realised volatility of that day
