    Calculates a volatility for the given series of returns or prices. If a PricesSeries is given,
    the calculation window is shorter by 1 due to the initial conversion into returns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    qf_series: QFSeries
        series of prices/returns (as numbers, e.g. 0.5 corresponds to 50% return)
    frequency: Frequency
        the frequency of samples in the returns series; it is only obligatory to specify frequency if the annualise
        parameter is set to True, which is a default value
    annualise: bool
        True if the volatility values should be annualised; False otherwise. If it is set to True, then it is obligatory
        to specify a frequency of the returns series.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        volatility for the whole series.
