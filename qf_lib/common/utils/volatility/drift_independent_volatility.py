        Implementation of the algorithm described in 'Drift Independent Volatility Estimation Based on High, Low,
        Open and Close Prices', developed by Dennis Yang and Qiang Zhang, published in June 2000 issue of Journal
        of Business. The new estimator has the following nice properties:

        - unbiased in the continuous limit,
        - independent of the drift,
        - dealing with opening price jumps in a consistent way,
        - smallest variance among all estimators with the similar properties.

        Parameters
        ----------
        ohlc: PricesDataFrame
            QFDataFrame consisting of four QFPricesSeries: open, high, low, close
        frequency: Frequency
            the frequency of samples in the returns series; it is only obligatory to specify frequency if the annualise
            parameter is set to True, which is a default value
        annualise: bool
            True if the volatility values should be annualised; False otherwise. If it is set to True, then it is obligatory
            to specify a frequency of the returns series.
        alpha: float
            expectation of u(u-c)+d(d-c) squared, values in range of (1.331, 1.5);
            authors of the algorithm suggest 1.34 in practice
