    Calculates the rolling volatility for the given series of returns. If the annualise parameter is set to be True,

    Parameters
    ----------
    qf_series: QFSeries
        series of returns or prices
    frequency: Frequency
        the frequency of samples in the returns series; it is only obligatory to specify frequency if the annualise
        parameter is set to True, which is a default value
    annualise: bool
        True if the volatility values should be annualised; False otherwise. If it is set to True, then it is obligatory
        to specify a frequency of the returns series.
    window_size: int
        number of samples from which the rolling volatility will be calculated. If it is not set, then only overall
        volatility (of the whole series) will be calculated

    Returns
    -------
    QFSeries
        Series of volatility values for each day concerning last window_size days.
