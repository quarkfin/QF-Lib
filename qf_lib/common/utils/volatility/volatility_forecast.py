class VolatilityForecast:
    """
    Creates class used for vol forecasting: describes the volatility forecast configuration as well as the input
    and output data (output is created and assigned by calling one of the class methods).

    An instance of this class should describe one specific forecast and store its parameters.
    Parameters should NOT be modified after calling one of the calculation methods (only one call is allowed)

    Parameters
    ----------
    returns_tms: QFSeries
        series of returns of the asset
    vol_process: VolatilityProcess
        volatility process used for forecasting. For example EGARCH(p=p, o=o, q=q)
    horizon: str
        horizon for the volatility forecast. It is expressed in the frequency of the returns provided
    method: int
        method of forecast calculation. Possible: 'analytic', 'simulation' or 'bootstrap'
        'analytic' is the fastest but is not available for EGARCH and possibly some other models.
        For details check arch documentation
    annualise: bool
        flag indicating whether the result is annualised; True by default
    frequency: Frequency
        if annualise is True, this should be the frequency of the returns timeseries that is provided as input;
        not used if annualise is False.
