        Parameters
        ----------
        mu
            mean of the distribution of returns
        sigma
            standard deviation of the returns
        starting_price
            price of the stock at the beginning of the cone
        number_of_steps
            horizon for which the expected value is calculated
        random_element
            corresponds to the N(0,1). is expressed in number of standard deviations.
            Use 1 to model 1std up move,
            Use 0 to model expected vale of the stock

        Returns
        -------

            Expected value of the stock after number_of_steps given the input parameters

        Parameters
        ----------
        mu
            mean return of the process. expressed in the frequency of samples (not annualised)
        sigma
            std of returns of the process. expressed in the frequency of samples (not annualised)
        number_of_std
            corresponds to the randomness of the stochastic process. reflects number of standard deviations
            to get expected values for. For example 1.0 means 1 standard deviation above the expected value.
        number_of_steps
            length of the cone that we are creating
        starting_value
            corresponds to the starting price of the instrument
