    Aggregates returns by week, month, or year. Note: The cumulative returns function replaces all Nans with 0.000.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series: QFSeries
        Daily returns of the strategy, noncumulative.
    convert_to: Frequency
        Can be 'weekly', 'monthly', or 'yearly'.
    multi_index: bool

    Returns
    -------
    SimpleReturnsSeries
        Aggregated returns.
