def drawdown_tms(input_data: InputData, frequency: Frequency = None) -> InputData:

    Calculates the timeseries of the same dates as prices_tms, which contains the drawdown value for each date.

    Parameters
    ----------

    input_data: QFSeries, QFDataFrame
        QF timeseries or multiple timeseries grouped into a DataFrame

    frequency: Frequency
        optional parameter that improves teh performance of the function as
        to_prices does not need to infer the frequency

    Returns
    -------
    QFSeries, QFDataFrame
        series of drawdowns (drawdown for each day). Drawdown for a given date is defined as the percentage difference
        between the the maximal price value up to the given date and the price value for that date.
