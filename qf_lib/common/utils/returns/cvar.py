    Calculates Conditional Value at Risk for a given percentage. Percentage equal to 0.05 means 5% CVaR.

    ----------
    qf_series: QFSeries
        Series of returns/prices

        Percentage defining CVaR (what percentage of worst-case scenarios should be considered"

    float
        Conditional value at risk as a number from range (-1,1). Simplifying: means how much money can be lost
        in the worst "percentage" % of all cases.
