def tail_events(benchmark_tms: QFSeries, examined_tms: QFSeries, tail_percentile: float) -> [QFSeries, QFSeries]:
    """
    Gets tail events of the benchmark and corresponding events in the examined timeseries. Both benchmark_tms
    and examined_tms must be of the same length. Moreover, events on each position in both series must be corresponding.

    Example: for the tail_percentile = 16 all the events of the benchmark with values to the left from one standard
    deviation will be returned (along with corresponding events from examined_tms).

    Parameters
    ----------
    benchmark_tms: QFSeries
        timeseries corresponding to the benchmark
    examined_tms: QFSeries
        timeseries corresponding to the examined asset
    tail_percentile: float
        Percentile to compute. Must be a number from range [0,100]

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[QFSeries, QFSeries]
        (benchmark_tail_tms, examined_tail_tms) - tail events of the benchmark, events from the
        examined series corresponding to the benchmark's tail events
