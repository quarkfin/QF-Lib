    Finds maximal drawdown for the given timeseries of prices.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input_data: QFSeries, QFDataFrame
        timeseries of prices/returns
    frequency: Frequency
        optional parameter that improves teh performance of the function it is not need to infer the frequency

    Returns
    -------
        maximal drawdown for the given timeseries of prices expressed as the percentage value (e.g. 0.5 corresponds
        to the 50% drawdown)
