def ta_series(func: Callable, *args, **kwargs) -> QFSeries:
    """
    Function created to allow using TA-Lib functions with QFSeries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func
        talib function: for example talib.MA
    args
        time series arguments to the function. They are all passed as QFSeries.
        for example: 'close' or 'high, low, close' where each argument is a QFSeries.
    kwargs
        additional arguments to the function. for example: 'timeperiod=10' or 'timeperiod=timeperiod, matype=i'.
        All additional arguments have to be passed as keyword arguments.

    Returns
    -------
    QFSeries
        Output from the talib function encapsulated in a QFSeries
