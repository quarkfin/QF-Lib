class ElasticNetFactorsIdentifierSimplified(FactorsIdentifier):
    """
    Class used for identifying factors in the model with Elastic Net method (with Cross-validation). Implementation
    was simplified so that the stock ElasticNetCV optimizer was used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    epsilon
         if abs(coefficient) is smaller than epsilon it is considered to be zero, thus won't be included
         in the model
    l1_ratio
        value between [0,1] the higher the simpler and more sensitive model is to collinear factors
    number_of_alphas
        number of different lambda values tested
    is_fit_intercept
        True if intercept should be included in the model, False otherwise

    """

    NUMBER_OF_FOLDS = 10
    """ number of folds in the k-fold cross-validation. """

    MIN_NUM_OF_1SE_REGRESSORS = 2
    """
    minimal number of regressors taken for the alpha_1se (max. alpha for which the MSE is within 1 std.
    from the min. MSE). If number of regressors is smaller, then coefficients for min. MSE are taken.
