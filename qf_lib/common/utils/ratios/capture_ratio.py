    Upside / Downside Capture Ratio
    This ratio is a statistical measure of a Fund Manager's overall performance in down or up markets.
    For example Downside Capture Ratio is used to evaluate how well or poorly the Manager performed
    relative to a specific index during periods when that index has dropped (had negative returns).
    The ratio is calculated by dividing the Strategy returns by the returns of the index during the down-market
    Downside Capture Ratio = sum(Strategy  Returns) / sum(Index Returns)

    A Fund Manager who has a downside capture ratio less than 1 has outperformed the index during the down-market
    by falling less than the index. For instance, a ratio of 0.75 indicates that the portfolio declined only 75%
    as much as the index during the period under consideration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    strategy:
        series of the strategy that will be evaluated
    benchmark:
        series of the benchmark for the strategy
    upside_capture: bool
        True - for upside capture ratio
        False - for downside capture ratio
    frequency: Frequency
        Frequency on which the the ratio is evaluated.
        For example Frequency.MONTHLY will result in evaluating the ration based on Monthly returns.

    Returns
    -------
    float
