    Aggregates prices in the prices_tms by calculating the average weighted price for each period. The average weighted
    prices are weighted by the volumes traded in each period.

    Parameters
    ----------

        timeseries of prices which should be aggregated
    volumes_tms: QFSeries
        timeseries of volumes traded; must correspond to the prices_tms
