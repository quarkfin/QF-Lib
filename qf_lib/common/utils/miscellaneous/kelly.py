def kelly(qf_series: QFSeries) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the value of the Kelly Criterion (the fraction of money that should be invested) for the series
    of returns/prices.

    Kelly Criterion assumptions:
    1. You trade the same way you traded in the past.
    2. Each return corresponds to one trade.
    3. Returns are normally distributed (calculated value will be close to the ideal kelly value even for highly skewed
    returns. Test showed that the difference of up to 10% (relative) might occur for extremely skewed distributions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    qf_series: QFSeries
        timeseries of returns/prices. Each return/price must correspond to one trade.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        fraction of money that should be invested

def kelly_binary(win_probability: float, win_size: float, lose_size: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the value of the Kelly Criterion (the fraction of money that should be invested) for a bet
    that has two possible outcomes.

    NOTE: This method should not be used to estimate the kelly value for a timeseries.

    Parameters
    ----------
    win_probability:float
        probability of winning. Assumes that probability of losing is 1 - win_probability.
    win_size: float
        gain if we win.
        For example: 0.7 means that we get additional 70% of what we bet. (if we bet 10$ and we win we now have 17$)
        new_value = old_value * (1 + win_size)
    lose_size: float
        lose if we lose. This value should be negative.
        For example: -0.2 means that we lose 20% of what we bet. (if we bet 10$ and we lose we now have 8$)
        new_value = old_value * (1 + lose_size)
    Returns
    -------
    float
        fraction of money that should be invested
