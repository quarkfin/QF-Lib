    Parameters
    ----------
    prices_df
        PricesDataFrame of at least 2 series: PriceField.Open and PriceField.Close
    initial_price
        initial price of the timeseries. If no price will be specified, then it will be assumed to be 1.
    transaction_cost_percentage
        cost of a single transaction [%]; percentage of the transaction value
        by default set to 0
        can't have a non-zero value if transaction_cost_value is set!
    transaction_cost_value
        cost of a single transaction [currency of examined asset]

        can't have a non-zero value if transaction_cost_percentage is set!

    Returns

        price changes
