    MINBTL Calculates the minimum length of backtest given the number of trials during optimising
    the strategy. The function assumes that the distribution of qualities (e.g. Sharpe Ratios) is a normal
    distribution (mu=0, sig=1).

    The concept of the Minimum Backtest Length is presented by Bailey, Borwein, Prado and Zhu in  the
    'PseudoMathematics and Financial Charlatanism: The Effects of Backtest Overfitting on Out-of-Sample Performance'.

    Parameters
    ----------
    number_of_trials: Union[int, QFSeries],
        the number of trials made during optimising the algorithm (can be a QFSeries of ints)
    estimated_maximum: float
        estimated maximum value of a quality (e.g. Sharpe Ratio) (by default: 1)

    Returns
    --------
    Union[float, QFSeries]
        float defining minimum backtest length in case if the number_of_trials was an integer
