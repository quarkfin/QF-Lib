        Solves the problem defined by matrix h, vector f and constraints.

        Parameters
        ----------
        P
            a square matrix from the quadratic formula
        q
            a vector (can be empty) from the quadratic formula
        upper_constraints
            vector of upper limits of weights (if it's a single value, the constraint will be the same for each weight).
            Example: 0.5 means that max allocation of some asset can be 50%.

        Returns
        -------
        weights
            best weights for the given problem. Sum of all weights is equal 1.
