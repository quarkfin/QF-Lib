"""
In quadratic solvers there are two types of constraints: equality constraints and inequality constraints.

Equality constraints are expressed in the form of: A*x == b, where A is a matrix (so called multiplier)
and b is a vector of values. A*x is a dot product of the multiplier and a vector of weights (which is the result
of the optimization process).

Inequality constraints are expressed as: G*x <= h, where G is a matrix (multiplier) and h is a vector of values.
G*x is a dot product of matrix G and a weights' vector (x).
