This module offers a comprehensive set of containers for financial data analysis, including series, dataframes, data arrays, and futures-related objects.

Each container type is designed with specialized classes to handle various aspects of financial data, such as price series, return calculations, and futures contract management.
These classes streamline the processing and analysis of complex financial datasets, providing a robust framework for quantitative finance research.

Notes:
  - When constructing a container object, the input data is typically expected to be in a wide format. For example:
    - A `PricesSeries` object might be initialized with a DataFrame where each column represents the price history of a different asset.
    - A `QFDataArray` can be created using multi-dimensional arrays to represent time, asset, and other axes of data.
