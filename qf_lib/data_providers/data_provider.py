        Gets historical attributes (fields) of different securities (tickers).

        All the duplicate fields and tickers will be removed (the first occurrence will remain). This is crucial
        for having the expected behavior with using label-based indices. E.g. let's assume there is a duplicate ticker
        'SPX Index' in tickers list and the result data frame has two columns 'SPX Index'. Then when someone
        runs result.loc[:, 'SPX Index'], he expects to get a series of 'SPX Index' values. However
        he'll get a data frame with two columns, both named 'SPX Index'.
