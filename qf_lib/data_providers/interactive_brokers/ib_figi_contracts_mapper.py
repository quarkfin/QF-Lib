class IBFIGItoIBContractMapper:
    """
    IB IBFIGItoIBContractMapper mapper that can be used to map FIGI defined IB contracts to the more specific ones.
    It is possible to define contracts like in the example for AAPL:

    ib_contract = IBContract()
    ib_contract.secIdType = "FIGI"
    ib_contract.secId = "BBG000B9XRY4"
    ib_contract.exchange = "SMART"

    However, some functionality like requesting historical data does not work with FIGI identifiers at this point.
    Therefore mapping of FIGI contracts to the more general IB Contacts is required. This class might be removed in
    the future when IB will add support to use FIGI contracts for the rest purposes.
