    """
    Utility decorator, which takes a function and a given argument (identified by arg_name) representing a list,
    divides the list into chunks of the given size (chunk_size), executes the wrapped function separately for each
    chunk and returns the result for each chunk in form of a list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arg_name: str
        The name of the parameter passed to the wrapped function, which should be divided into chunks. Must be of
        list type.
    chunk_size: int
        The size of the chunks
