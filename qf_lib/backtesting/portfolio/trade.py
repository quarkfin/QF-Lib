class Trade(object):
    """
    Trade represents a pair of transactions that go in the opposite directions.
    For example we buy 10 shares of X and then we sell 3 shares of X. This creates a trade when we buy and sell 3
    shares of X

    Parameters
    -----------
    start_time: datetime
        moment when we opened the position corresponding to this trade
    end_time: datetime
        moment when we close the trade
    contract: Contract
        contract defining the security
    quantity: int
        number of shares traded
    entry_price: float
        price at which the instrument has been bought (excluding all fees and commission)
    exit_price: float
        price at which the trade was closed (excluding all fees and commission)
    commission: float
        all the transaction costs related to the trade.
        It includes the cost of opening the position and also cost of reducing it.
        commission is expressed in currency units
    risk_as_percent: float
        max percentage risk that we aim to have on this instrument.
        for example it could be the the percentage that is used to calculate the stop price.
