class Trade:
    """
    Trade is a logical unit representing getting exposure to the market (long or short) finished by closing the
    position. Trade begins with new position opened and finishes when the position is closed.
    Note: For futures contracts, automated rolling of the contract will result in closing the existing exposure on the
    specific ticker, and therefore will generate a trade.

    Parameters
    -----------
    start_time: datetime
        Moment when we opened the position corresponding to this trade.
    end_time: datetime
        Moment when we close the trade.
    ticker: Ticker
        Ticker defining the security.
    pnl: float
        Profit or loss associated with a trade expressed in currency units including transaction costs and commissions.
    commission: float
        All the transaction costs related to the trade. It includes the cost of opening the position and also cost
        of reducing it. Expressed in currency units.
    direction: int
        Direction of the position: Long = 1, Short = -1. Defined by the initial transaction.
    percentage_pnl: float
       Total pnl divided by the most recent value of the portfolio.
