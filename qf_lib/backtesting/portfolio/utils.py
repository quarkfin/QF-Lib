def split_transaction_if_needed(existing_quantity: float, transaction: Transaction) \
            -> Tuple[bool, Transaction, Optional[Transaction]]:
    """
    Splits the given transaction into two if needed. The split occurs, in case if the transaction would result in the
    change of existing position direction, e.g. assuming there exist 200 shares of a certain contract in the portfolio,
    a Transaction of quantity = -500, should be divided into:
    - closing Transaction with the quantity = -200
    - remaining Transaction with the quantity = -300
    Commissions are adjusted proportionally.

    Parameters
    -----------
    existing_quantity: float
        Number of shares of the given contract, already existing in the portfolio
    transaction: Transaction
        transaction that eventually needs to be split

    Returns
    --------
    Tuple[bool, Transaction, Optional[Transaction]]
        boolean indicating whether the split was performed (True) or not (False) and the transaction (transactions)
