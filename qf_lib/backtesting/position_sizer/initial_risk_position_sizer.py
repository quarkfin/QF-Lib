    This PositionSizer converts signals to orders using Initial Risk value that is predefined in the position sizer.

    ----------

    order_factory: OrderFactory
    initial_risk: float
        should be set once for all signals. It corresponds to the value that we are willing to lose
        on single trade. For example: initial_risk = 0.02, means that we are willing to lose 2% of portfolio value in
        single trade
    max_target_percentage: float
        max leverage that is accepted by the position sizer.
        if None, no max_target_percentage is used.
    tolerance_percentage: float
        percentage used by OrdersFactory target_percent_orders function; it defines tolerance to the
