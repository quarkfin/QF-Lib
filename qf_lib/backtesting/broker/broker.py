    -----------
    contract_ticker_mapper: ContractTickerMapper
        object which contains a set of parameters for every ticker and allows to map a ticker onto a broker specific
        contract / ticker object that could be afterwards used while sending the Order. For example in case of
        Interactive Brokers the mapper provides the functionality which allows to map a ticker from any data provider
        (BloombergTicker, PortaraTicker etc.) onto the contract object from the Interactive Brokers API. The parameters
        which are necessary depend on the Broker class.
