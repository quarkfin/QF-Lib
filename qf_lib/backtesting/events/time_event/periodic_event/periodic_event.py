class PeriodicEvent(TimeEvent, metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """
    TimeEvent which is triggered every certain amount of time (given a certain frequency) within a predefined time
    range.

    As some of the available frequencies (like e.g. Frequency.MIN_15) can not be implemented using only one
    RegularTimeEvent, the PeriodicEvent contains a list of multiple custom RegularTimeEvents (_events_list).
    Each of these RegularTimeEvents contains its own _trigger_time_rule. These rules are used to define the desired
    frequency of PeriodicEvent.

    E.g. PeriodicEvent, which has the frequency parameter set to Frequency.MIN_15 is further translated to a list
    of multiple RegularTimeEvents, which correspond to RegularDateTimeRules with following trigger time parameters:

    {"minute": 0, "second": 0, "microsecond": 0} - event triggered at every full hour, eg. 12:00, 13:00 etc.
    {"minute": 15, "second": 0, "microsecond": 0} - event triggered at 12:15, 13:15 etc.
    {"minute": 30, "second": 0, "microsecond": 0} - event triggered at 12:30, 13:30 etc.
    {"minute": 45, "second": 0, "microsecond": 0} - event triggered at 12:45, 13:45 etc.

    All the above defined Events together, create an Event which is triggered every 15 minutes.

    The PeriodicEvent is triggered only within the [start_time, end_time] time range with the given frequency.
    It is triggered always at the start_time, but not necessarily at the end_time.
    E.g.
        start_time = {"hour": 13, "minute": 20, "second": 0, "microsecond": 0},
        end_time = {"hour": 16, "minute": 0, "second": 0, "microsecond": 0},
        frequency = Frequency.MIN_30

        This event will be triggered at 13:20, 13:50, 14:20, 14:50, 15:20, 15:50, but not at 16:00.

    Both start_time and end_time dictionaries should contain "hour", "minute", "second" and "microsecond" fields.
