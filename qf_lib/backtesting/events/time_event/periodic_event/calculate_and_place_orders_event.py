    Class used for triggering calculation of signals and placing orders.
    Alternative class to do it is CalculateAndPlaceOrdersRegularEvent
    This should be used as a trigger for a a strategy to run calculations.

    Example:
        CalculateAndPlaceOrdersPeriodicEvent.set_frequency(Frequency.MIN_15)
        CalculateAndPlaceOrdersPeriodicEvent.set_start_and_end_time(
            start_time={"hour": 8, "minute": 0, "second": 0, "microsecond": 0},

        will results in notifier being triggered at 8:00, 8:15, 8:30, ..., 16:15
