        When an Event of certain type is being dispatched by EventManager then what EventManger
        does is it finds the EventNotifier which corresponds to this type of Event. Then the EventNotifier
        notifies all its EventListeners about an Event which occurred. However there might be some EventListeners
        which are listening to the more general type of Event (super-type of the event) and they should also be
        notified.

        That's why the EventNotifier will also call an EventNotifier specific to a more general type of Events
        which will then notify all its EventListeners. The chain of calls on different
        EventNotifiers goes on until the AllEventNotifier is called. That one corresponds to the most general
        type of Events (the Event). When EventListeners subscribed to the Event are notified in the end
        the process of notifications is over.

        Because of the fact that each EventNotifier also calls the EventNotifier for Events of more general type,
        each EventNotifier must have a reference to this "more general" EventNotifier. Most of Events inherit
        directly from the Event type. That's why most of notifiers will need a reference to AllEventNotifier.
