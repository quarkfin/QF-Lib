class DataHandler(DataProvider):
    """
    DataHandler is a wrapper which can be used with any AbstractPriceDataProvider in both live and backtest
    environment. It makes sure that data "from the future" is not passed into components in the backtest environment.

    DataHandler should be used by all the Backtester's components (even in the live trading setup).

    The goal of a DataHandler is to provide backtester's components with financial data. It makes sure that
    no data from the future (relative to a "current" time of a backtester) is being accessed, that is: that there
    is no look-ahead bias.

    Parameters
    -----------
    data_provider: DataProvider
        the underlying data provider
    timer: Timer
        timer used to keep track of the data "from the future"
