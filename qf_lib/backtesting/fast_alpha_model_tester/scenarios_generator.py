        Utility function to generate different trades scenarios, where each scenario is a series of returns for a given
        investment strategy.
        The scenarios of a given length are created by randomly choosing (with replacement) returns from the original
        sequence of a Trade's returns. The result is the SimpleReturnsDataFrame which is indexed by the Trade's
        ordinal number and has a scenario in each column.

        Parameters
        ----------
        trade_rets: Sequence[float]
            sequence of floats which represent the returns on Trades performed by some investment strategy

        Creates a random series, which contains information about the exposure of a certain asset for the given dates

        generates random trades and fills the rows for corresponding dates with the desired exposure.
        In case if the number of trades provided is too high to create non-adjacent trades, which will together occupy
        <time_in_the_market>% percentage of time, the time span between some of the consecutive trades may be set to 0.
        In that case it may seem as if the returned number of trades was smaller than the expected number of trades.
