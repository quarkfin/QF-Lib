    Wrapper, which facilitates the subscription process of the Strategy to the BeforeMarketOpenEvent.
    After the creation of a strategy object, in order to proceed with the signal generation and orders placement
    every day at the BeforeMarketOpenEvent, it is necessary to encapsulate the strategy in the following way:

    strategy = ExampleStrategy(trading_session)
    OnBeforeMarketOpenSignalGeneration(strategy)

    This will ensure, that every day (from Monday to Friday) before the market open time, the calculate_and_place_orders
    will be executed.

    It requires the trigger_time of the BeforeMarketOpenEvent event to be set properly set, by calling the
    ``set_trigger_time`` function before using the OnBeforeMarketOpenSignalGeneration.
