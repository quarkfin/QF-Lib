class Signal(object):
    """
    Objects of this class are used in the portfolio construction process. They are returned by AlphaModels to
    determine the suggested trend direction as well as its strength

    Parameters
    ----------
    ticker: Ticker
        Ticker for which the signal was generated
    suggested_exposure: Exposure
        A value of type Exposure which describes the move suggested by a specific AlphaModel - SHORT, LONG or OUT
    fraction_at_risk: float
        A percentage value which determines the risk factor for an AlphaModel and a specified Ticker, may be used
        to calculate the position size.
        For example: Value of 0.02 means that we should place a Stop Loss 2% below the latest available
        price of the instrument. This value should always be positive
    confidence: float
        A float value in range [0;1] which describes the trust level for the AlphaModel in a current situation.
        By default set to 1.0 (maximum)
    expected_move: float
        A percentage value which determines an expected price change for the upcoming period, may by positive
        (uptrend) or negative (downtrend) and the range is unlimited
    alpha_model
        reference to the alpha model that generated the signal
