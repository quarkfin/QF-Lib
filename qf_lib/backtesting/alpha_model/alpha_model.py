    ----------

        float value which estimates the risk level of the specific AlphaModel. Corresponds to the level at which
        the stop-loss should be placed.

        ----------
        ticker: Ticker

        current_exposure: Exposure

        current_time: datetime

        For example: Value of 0.02 means that we should place a Stop Loss 2% below the latest available
