class VolumeShareSlippage(Slippage):
    """
    Slippage based on the daily volume of the traded assets. It can limit the Order's volume. The price slippage is
    calculated by multiplying no-slippage-price by (1 + volume-share^2 * self.price_impact).

    The direction of the slippage is always making the price worse for the trader (it increases the price when
    buying and decreases when selling).

    This model needs to know the daily volume of the traded asset, thus the model can be only applied at the end
    of the day, when the full bar for that day is already available.

    Parameters
    ----------
    volume_share_limit: float
        number from range [0,1] which denotes how big (volume-wise) the Order can be i.e. if it's 0.5 and a daily
        volume for a given asset is 1,000,000 USD, then max volume of the Order can be 500,000 USD
    price_impact: float
        factor which implies how big will be the slippage
