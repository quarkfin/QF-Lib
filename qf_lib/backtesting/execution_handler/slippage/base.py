        Calculates fill prices for Orders. For Orders that can't be executed (missing security price, etc.) float("nan")
        will be returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        orders: Sequence[Order]
            sequence of Orders for which the fill price should be calculated
        no_slippage_fill_prices: Sequence[float]
            fill prices without a slippage applied. Each fill price corresponds to the Order from `orders` list

        Returns
        -------
        Tuple[Sequence[float], Sequence[int]]
            sequence of fill prices (order corresponds to the order of orders provided as an argument of the method)
