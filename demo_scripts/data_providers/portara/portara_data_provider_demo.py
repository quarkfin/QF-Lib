""" PortaraDataProvider Demo

This module demonstrates the most important functionality of the Portara data provider. It provides examples on how to
download price data for individual or continuous contracts.

These examples may be run using the sample Portara data, which is available at https://www.portaracqg.com/sample-data/.

It is important to save the price data as csv, in order to not confuse the pricing data files with the files containing
expiration dates.

    In order to run the example you need to provide the path to the top directory, containing your data files. The

    Notes
    ---------
    The file containing data for the ticker should have the same name as the ticker that you are passing as the
    parameter. For example if you want to run this example for EP2018M, you should name your data file "EP2018M.csv"
    and download the prices using PortaraTicker("EP2018M").
